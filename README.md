# Very Simple To Do App (VSTDA)

This application keeps track if items that you need to accomplish and gives you the option to categorize them by priority level.

## Using the Application

On the left hand side write in what you want to accomplish and select a priority level. Once you submit an item "to do" it will populate on the right hand side of the screen with the appropriate level of priority (red for 'high', yellow for 'medium', and green for 'low'). You also have the option to delete a "to do" item once it's done or edit it if the priority/item changes.
